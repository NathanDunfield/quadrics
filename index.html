<h1>Interactive Gallery of Quadric Surfaces</h1>
<table><tr>

<td valign="top"> <p>Quadric surfaces are important objects in
Multivariable Calculus and Vector Analysis classes. We like them
because they are natural 3D-extensions of the so-called <span
style="font-style: italic;">conics</span> (ellipses, parabolas, and
hyperbolas), and they provide examples of fairly nice surfaces to use
as examples for the rest of your class.</p>

<p>The basic quadric surfaces are described by the following
  equations, where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are
  constants.</p>

  <p>
  \begin{gather*}
  z= Ax^2+By^2 \qquad\qquad\qquad z^2=Ax^2+By^2\\
  \frac{x^2}{A^2}+\frac{y^2}{B^2} - \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1 \qquad\qquad
  -\frac{x^2}{A^2}-\frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1\\
  \frac{x^2}{A^2}+\frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1 
  \end{gather*}
  </p>

<p>Rather than memorize the equations, you should learn how to <a href="cross.html">examine cross sections</a> to figure out what surface a given equation represents.</p>

<h3 align="center">Using This Gallery</h3>
<p>In this gallery you'll find interactive pictures of the quadric
surfaces.  You can see what the cross sections look like, and also
see how various coefficients can affect how they look. These
pictures all include "sliders," like the following two examples.
The picture on the left shows a sphere with an adjustable radius; click
and drag the blue dot to change it. The picture on the right
shows you the various cross sections of the sphere. Click and
drag the blue dots to adjust the chosen values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
You can also rotate the pictures and zoom in or out.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten the hang of these two demos, you're ready to look at
the gallery images. Use the menu at upper left portion of this page to
choose which quadric surface you'd like to see.</p>

<h3 align="center">A Note about Domains</h3>

<p>Sometimes a computer can graph a surface in more than one way.
Look at the two pictures below; they both show graphs of the function
\(z = x^2+y^2\).  The one on the left is probably more familiar, and
it's what most of us would draw by hand.  The picture on the right can
be useful, though, because the gridlines on the surface show you the
cross sections \(x=c\) and \(y=c\) of the surface.</p>

<img src="static_images/parabcirc.png" border="0" alt="Paraboloid" />
<img src="static_images/parabsq.png" border="0" alt="Paraboloid" />
</center>
<p>
In technical terms, the two pictures show graphs of the same function
but with different domains.  On the left the domain is a <i>disk</i>,
described by
$$
0 \leq x^2 + y^2 \leq 2
$$
On the right, the domain is a <i>square</i>,
$$
\begin{align}
  -1 \leq x \leq 1  \\
  -1 \leq y \leq 1 
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p> In this gallery I've drawn a lot of surfaces with square domains
to emphasize the vertical cross sections.  I've also included buttons
below certain pictures which let you change the domain to a disk.  You
might be surprised how different some of the pictures will look when
you change the domain.</p>

<p>In fact, that leads to a good way to gauge how well you understand
the quadric surfaces.  On each page you'll be able to adjust the
coefficients of the equation.  Do this with both domains, and see if
you can tell that it affects both graphs in the same way.  </p>

<p>This gallery was written by Jonathan Rogness and first appeared in
  the <a href="http://www.maa.org/node/115856">2005 volume of Journal of
  Online Mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>In 2016, <a href="http://dunfield.info">Nathan Dunfield</a> redid
  the interactive 3D graphics from scratch using <a
  href=http://threejs.org>three.js</a> instead of <a
  href="http://wwwvis.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~kraus/LiveGraphics3D/index.html">LiveGraphics3D</a>
  so they work on web browsers that lack Java.  Some updates from <a
  href="http://mathinsight.org/quadric_surfaces">MathInsight.org</a>
  were also incorporated into this version.  </p>
