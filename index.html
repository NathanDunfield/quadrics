	<p>Quadric surfaces are important objects in
	    Multivariable Calculus and Vector Analysis classes. We like them
	    because they are natural 3D-extensions of the so-called
	    <span style="font-style: italic;">conics</span> (ellipses, parabolas, and
	    hyperbolas), and they provide fairly nice surfaces to use
	    as examples for the rest of your class.</p>

	<p>The basic quadric surfaces are described by the following
	    five equations, where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are constants.</p>

	<div class="eqnbox">
	    <div class="eqn">\(\displaystyle z = A x^2 + B y^2\)</div>
	    <div class="eqn">\(\displaystyle z^2 = A x^2+ B y^2\)</div>
	    <div class="eqn">\(\displaystyle  \frac{x^2}{A^2}+\frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1 \)</div>
	    <div  class="eqn">\(\displaystyle \frac{x^2}{A^2}+\frac{y^2}{B^2} - \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1 \)</div>
	    <div class="eqn">\(\displaystyle -\frac{x^2}{A^2}-\frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1\)</div>
	</div>
    
	<p>
	    Rather than memorize the equations, you should learn how
	    to examine cross sections to figure out what surface a
	    given equation represents, as I will describe below.

	<h2>Using This Gallery</h2>
  
	<p>
	    In this gallery you&rsquo;ll find interactive pictures of
	    the quadric surfaces. You can see what the cross sections look
	    like, and also see how various coefficients can affect how
	    they look. These pictures all include &ldquo;sliders&rdquo;,
	    like the following two examples. The first picture shows a
	    sphere with an adjustable radius; click and drag the blue
	    slider to change it. You can rotate the sphere by grabbing
	    and dragging. You can also zoom in or out using the scroll
	    wheel on your mouse or equivalent touch motion.
	</p>

	<div class="threecontainer" id="basicsphere">
	    <canvas class="threejs"></canvas>
	    <div class="threecontrols">
		<div class="slidergroup">
		    <div class="sliderlabel">
			radius = 2.3
		    </div>
		    <div class="threeslider">
		    </div>
		</div>
		<div class="slidergroup">
		    <div class="sliderlabel">
			Gridlines: <input type="checkbox">
		    </div>
		    <div class="sliderlabel">
			Surface:
			<select>
			    <option value="invisible">Invisible</option>
			    <option value="transparent">Transparent</option>
			    <option value="solid" selected="selected">Solid</option>
			</select>
		    </div>
		    <div class="sliderlabel">
			<button>Reset view</button>
		    </div>
		</div>
	    </div>
	</div>

	<p>At the bottom of the picture there are some additional
	    controls over how the surface is shown: you can change the
	    material the sphere is made out of and also show or hide
	    the gridlines. If you get &ldquo;lost&rdquo; when moving
	    around, the &ldquo;Reset view&rdquo; button will take you
	    back to where you started.</p>


	<p>
	    The second picture belows shows you various cross
	    sections of the sphere, that is, the intersection of the
	    sphere with a plane parallel to one of the coordinate
	    planes. The picture initially shows the intersection of
	    the sphere of radius 2 with the three planes \(x = 1 \),
	    \(y = 1.4\), and \(z = -1.2\).  

	    Click and drag the blue sliders to adjust which plane is
	    being used to &ldquo;slice&rdquo; the sphere to produce
	    the cross section; while you are holding the slider, the
	    plane in question appears.  As with the previous picture,
	    you can (and should!) rotate and zoom to get a better view. 
	</p>

	<div class="threecontainer" id="slicedsphere">
	    <canvas class="threejs" ></canvas>
	    <div class="threecontrols">
		<div class="slidergroup">
		    <div class="sliderlabel">
			x = 1.0
		    </div>
		    <div class="threeslider">
		    </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="slidergroup">
		    <div class="sliderlabel">
			y = 1.0
		    </div>
		    <div class="threeslider">
		    </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="slidergroup">
		    <div class="sliderlabel">
			z = 1.0
		    </div>
		    <div class="threeslider">
		    </div>
		</div>
	    </div>
	</div>

<h2>A Note about Domains</h2>

<p>Sometimes a computer can graph a surface in more than one way.
Look at the two pictures below; they both show graphs of the function
\(z = x^2+y^2\).  The one on the left is probably more familiar, and
it's what most of us would draw by hand.  The picture on the right can
be useful, though, because the gridlines on the surface show you the
cross sections \(x=c\) and \(y=c\) of the surface.</p>

<center>
<img src="static_images/parabcirc.jpg" alt="Paraboloid"
style="min-width: 20%; max-width: 15em; margin: 1em">

<img src="static_images/parabsq.jpg" alt="Paraboloid"
style="min-width: 20%; max-width: 15em; margin: 1em">
</center>

<p>
In technical terms, the two pictures show graphs of the same function
but with different domains.  On the left the domain is a <i>disk</i>,
described by
$$
0 \leq x^2 + y^2 \leq 2
$$
On the right, the domain is a <i>square</i>,
$$
\begin{align}
  -1 \leq x \leq 1  \\
  -1 \leq y \leq 1 
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p> In this gallery I've drawn a lot of surfaces with square domains
to emphasize the vertical cross sections.  I've also included buttons
below certain pictures which let you change the domain to a disk.  You
might be surprised how different some of the pictures will look when
you change the domain.</p>

<p>In fact, that leads to a good way to gauge how well you understand
the quadric surfaces.  On each page you'll be able to adjust the
coefficients of the equation.  Do this with both domains, and see if
you can tell that it affects both graphs in the same way.  </p>

Now you're ready to look at the gallery images. Use the menu at the
top this page to choose which quadric surface you'd like to see!

<h2>Technical and Legal Details</h2>

<p>This gallery was written by Jonathan Rogness and first appeared in
    the <a href="http://www.maa.org/node/115856">2005 volume of
    the Journal of Online Mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>In 2016, <a href="http://dunfield.info">Nathan Dunfield</a> redid
    the interactive 3D graphics from scratch using <a href=http://threejs.org>three.js</a>
    instead of <a href="http://wwwvis.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~kraus/LiveGraphics3D/">LiveGraphics3D</a>
    so they work on web browsers that lack Java (which in 2016 is most of them). Dunfield also updated
    the styling to better support phones and smaller tablets, and switched
    to MathJax for displaying the formulas.
