Interactive Guide To Quadric Surfaces
=====================================

The original version of this gallery was written by Jonathan Rogness
and first appeared in the [2005 volume] of the Journal of Online
Mathematics; it can also be view on [Rogness's website].

In 2016, [Nathan Dunfield] redid the the interactive 3D graphics from
scratch using [three.js](http://threejs.org) instead of
[LiveGraphics3D]. This allows the guide to be viewed on web browsers
that lack Java (which in 2016 is most of them). Dunfield also updated
the styling to better support phones and smaller tablets, and switched
to [MathJax] for displaying the formulas.

You can view the current version at
