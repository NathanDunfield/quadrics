  <b>Equation:</b>

  $$\frac{x^2}{A^2}+\frac{y^2}{B^2} - \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1$$

  The hyperboloid of one sheet is possibly the most complicated of
  all the quadric surfaces.  For one thing, its equation is very
  similar to that of a hyperboloid of two sheets, which is confusing.
  (See the section on the two-sheeted hyperboloid for some tips on
  telling them apart.)  For another, its cross sections are quite
  complex.</p>

  <p>Having said all that, this is a shape familiar to any fan of the
  Simpsons, or even anybody who has only seen the beginning of the show.
  A hyperboloid of one sheet looks an awful lot like a cooling tower at
  the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.</p>

  <p>Below you can see the cross sections of a simple
  one-sheeted hyperboloid with \(A=B=C=1\).  The horizontal cross
  sections are ellipses -- circles, even, in this case -- while the
  vertical cross sections are hyperbolas.  The reason I said they are
  so complex is that these hyperbolas can open up and down <i>or</i>
  sideways, depending on what values you choose for \(x\) and
  \(y\).  Check the example and see for yourself.  Yikes!  If you
  do these cross sections by hand, you have to check an awful lot of
  special cases.</p>

  <p>The constants \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) once again
  affect how much the hyperboloid stretches in the \(x\)-,
  \(y\)-, and \(z\)-directions.  You can see this for
  yourself in the second picture.  Notice how quickly the hyperboloid
  grows, particularly in the \(z\)-direction.  When \(C=2\),
  a relatively small number, the surface already stretches from -8 to
      +8 on the \(z-\)axis.</p>

  <p>One caveat: the picture only shows a small portion of the
  hyperboloid, but it continues on forever.  So adjusting the value of
  \(C\) doesn't really make the surface taller -- it's already
  "infinitely" tall -- but it certainly does affect the shape and
  slope of the surface.  If you know something about partial
  derivatives, you could investigate how quickly \(z\) changes
  with respect to \(x\) and \(y\) for different values of
  \(C\).  You could also explore why adjusting \(C\) seems
  to have a more dramatic effect than changing \(A\) and
  \(B\).</p>

  <p>Here are a few more points for you to consider.</p>

  <ol> <li>Once again, the sliders don't go all the way to 0.  Why
    not?  Make all of them as small as possible and zoom in to see the
    resulting hyperboloid.</li>

    <li>Look at the equation.  What should happen when \(x=A\) or
    \(x=-A\)?  Check this in the first picture; recall that
    \(A=1\) there.</li>

    <li>Does there always have to be a "hole" through the hyperboloid,
    or could the sides touch at the origin?  In other words, could the
    cross section given by \(z=0\) ever be a point instead of an
    ellipse?  Experiment with the second picture; be sure to look directly
    from the top and zoom in before just assuming that the hole is
    gone.</li>
  </ol>
