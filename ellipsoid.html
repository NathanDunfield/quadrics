  <b>Equation:</b>
  $$\frac{x^2}{A^2}+\frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1$$


  <p>Just as an ellipse is a generalization of a circle, an ellipsoid is
  a generalization of a sphere.  In fact, our planet Earth is not a true
  sphere; it's an ellipsoid, because it's a little wider than it is
  tall.</p>
  
  <p>As you can verify to the left, all of the cross sections of an
  ellipsoid are ellipses.  The picture shows an ellipsoid where \(A=3\),
  \(B=2\), and \(C=1\).  Looking at the graph, this gives you a hint
  about how the constants affect the surface.  An ellipsoid centered at
  the origin stretches out \(A\) units in the positive and negative
  \(x\) direction; \(B\) units in the positive and negative \(y\)
  direction; and \(C\) units in the positive and negative \(z\)
  direction.</p>
  
  <p>What this means is that an ellipsoid is probably the easiest
  quadric surface to draw accurately.  (Or, if your drawing skills are
  like mine, you at least know what it <i>should</i> look like, even if
  the actual drawing is somewhat lacking!)</p>

  <p>You can interactively adjust the values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\)
  in the second picture.  Notice that you can get everything from a
  sphere to a nearly flat pancake.  Here are some things which deserve a
  little thought on your part:</p>
  
  <ol> <li>What needs to happen for an ellipsoid to be a sphere?</li>

  <li>The sliders don't actually go all the way to 0.  Make the values
  as small as you can and zoom in to verify this; you'll find you have a
  very small sphere.  (Its radius is 0.1, as it happens.)  Why didn't I
  make the sliders go all the way to 0?</li>

  <li>If you want to see an interesting effect, maximize all of the
  sliders and zoom in until you're inside the ellipsoid.  You can rotate
  around and look at the interior of the surface.  (This works best with
  the gridlines on.)</li>
  </ol>
